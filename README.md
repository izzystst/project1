Min Three players (can add as many as you want)
3 dice - sides are - L, C, R, blank, blank, blank
Each player is given three chips to start
Each dice side tells you what to do
L - chip to the left
R - chip to the right 
C- chip to the center pot
Blank - keep the chip
If you have less than 3 chips, you only roll dice for the chips you have
If you donâ€™t have chips, the dice skip you
To win: you want to be the last person with chips, and then you win the whole pot

This can be played with just one round, or you continues, and add up the points of the pot, and who ever has the most at the end of how ever many rounds you play is the overall winner
This could be a extended version, if I have time, allow for the user to select how many games they would like to play




Each player is given three chips to begin. 
One player begins and rolls the die
Their rolls dictates what happens to their chips
If they get a L - a chip goes to the left, a R - chip to the right , C- chip to the center, Blank - keep the chip
Game goes clockwise, next player does the same and it continues
If a player has less than 3 chips they only roll die for the number of chips they have (eg. 2 chips, 2 dice)


game starts (who goes first is randomly chosen)
First player rolls the dice
They get  R, blank, blank
Now they have 2 chips and player 3 (to their right) has 4
Player 2 rolls  - C, C, blank
Player 2: 1 chip, center: 2
Player 3 rolls - c, c, l 
Player 3: 1 chip, center: 4, player 1: 3
Player 1 rolls again : L, L, blank
Stats update: Player 1: 1 chip, Player 2: 3 chips, Player 3: 1 chip, center: 4 chips
Player 2 rolls : L, blank, blank
Player 3 rolls (2 chips so only 2 dice): R, blank
